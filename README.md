# ggj21-wfh-lost-and-found

My solo attempt at a game jam game for GGJ 2021. Theme is "Lost and Found".

Global Game Jam's official timeline is until Sunday 31st Jan evening, so I will make a note of which commit I was at then, and submit to Calgary's site.

I plan to work on it along Southampton Game Jam's timeline though, which is 2 weeks long. I think this idea has legs and I'd like to find enough time to work on it.

## Concept

You are on your way to an important meeting, but as you are walking there, you notice there are a lot of tourists in town today. And they all seem to be lost! Being the good samaritan that you are, when they stop you and ask for directions you try to help them.

Give a tourist directions, and if they get to their destination, you'll receive positive karma. Don't forget that you have somewhere to be though!
